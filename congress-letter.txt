This email is in regards to the "Stop Online Piracy Act" (http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h3261/show) and the PROTECT IP (http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-s968/show) that are currently being voted on.  I have taken the time to write this email because the issue being discussed is of great concern to me.  I say this both as a lifelong citizen of this country and as a web developer working in the technology industry.

You may say that these bills are only intended for sites that are legitimate copywrite offenders and will only do good but the reality is, in practice, this will be very difficult to control.  These bills will put the onus on the accused rather than the accuser.  Legitimate sites will end up being banned for no reason, it will place additional burdens on internet service/content providers to enforce this (and they will make mistakes), and the internet as we know it today will cease to exist.  The technology industry is one of America's biggest assets with the most potential for future growth and this will do nothing but weigh it down.

Additionally, this will do nothing to stop the problem it is trying to solve.  People interested in pirating content that is copyright will still find other ways to do it.  And just as people in China are able to circumvent the Great Chinese Firewall, people interested in pirating content in America will find ways to do the same.

The worst part is, the fruit that you are trying to protect (the content producers) will actually be damaged by these bills.  America is the cultural powerhouse that it is today because of the free flowing of ideas that enriches it.  Let's not put an end to this.

As I said, these bills are of great interest to me and I will be tracking their progress and instructing my peers to do the same.  I am counting on you to do the right thing and vote against these bills.
