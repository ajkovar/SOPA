Please cover the SOPA bill being considered in congress.  This bill is intended to stop online piracy but puts far too much power into the hands of Hollywood and music labels.  They have already shown that they have no problem abusing the power they currently have (http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-57344570-245/mystery-surrounds-universals-takedown-of-megaupload-youtube-video/).  This bill, if passed, will put in effect a censored version of the internet.

The worst part is, it will do little to nothing to solve the problem it is trying to solve.  DNS blocking can easily be circumvented by using offshore DNS servers.  Anyone with even a remote interest in stealing pirated content will be able to get around it.  People in other countries will also have no problem continuing on with pirating so this will not cause any additional cash flow into the country.  Everyday Americans, however, who are just trying to browse the web will have no idea that they are even being censored.

In spite of numerous warnings from prominent members of the technology industry about the affects this bill will have, it is still being pushed through.  Many congress members voting on this admit to having very little understanding of the internet and can only agree that online piracy sounds bad.

Please cover this story and help keep our internet open!
